Proactive Emotional Response System for E-commerce Support using BERT  

Description  
This project implements an Emotion Detection System using BERT to analyze customer queries in e-commerce support and respond with proactive emotional understanding. The system classifies text into various emotions and enhances user experience by generating appropriate responses.  

Features  
BERT-based Emotion Detection – Uses a pre-trained **RoBERTa** model for high-accuracy text classification.  
Multi-Emotion Classification – Detects emotions like happiness, anger, sadness, fear, etc.  
Real-time Processing – Provides instant feedback on customer emotions.  
-Multilingual Support – Integrates with language translation APIs.  
API for Integration – Exposes endpoints for front-end applications.  

Tech Stack  
Machine Learning Model: BERT (RoBERTa)  
Backend: Flask / Django (Python)  
Frontend: React.js (Optional for UI)  
Database: MongoDB / PostgreSQL (Optional for storing queries)  
Deployment: Docker, AWS (for hosting the model)
